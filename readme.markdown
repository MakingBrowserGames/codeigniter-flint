# Flint for CodeIgniter

Flint is a command line utility for CodeIgniter that allows you to quickly (and easily) generate files for your models (including DataMapper models), views, and controllers. Think of it like scaffolding in Rails, only much more lightweight.

## Setup and Usage

1. Download the files.
2. Move flint.php into the root of your CodeIgniter project (where index.php lives).
3. Fire up your terminal, `cd` into your CodeIgniter project, and type `php flint.php --help` to see how to use it.
